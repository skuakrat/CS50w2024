Distinctiveness and Complexity: 
-- Distinctiveness - This is a website built to help animals and help users by making it user-friendly. I have used all the coding from the previous courses and impliment to this project.
-- Complexity - The complexity of it is probably the models which are quite complicated. They are lots of parenting models. The platform categorizes animals by type, breed, and location, also user profile and direct messeges.
