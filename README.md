##Hello, welcome to my projects

These are the projects for CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course by Harvard University [Here](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript)

This course picks up where CS50 leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap.
